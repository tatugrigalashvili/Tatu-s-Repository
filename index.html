<h1>What is HTML?</h1>

<p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language <br>
    for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the <br>
    meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies <br>
    such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. <br>
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and <br>
    render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a <br>
    web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>

    <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation <br>
        of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). <br>
        CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. <br>
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. <br>
        This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation <br>
        characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, <br>
        which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load <br>
        speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
